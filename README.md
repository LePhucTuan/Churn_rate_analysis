Waze's free navigation app not only simplifies the journey for drivers worldwide but also enhances each drive for users. The collaborative efforts of Waze's community, including map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users, contribute to a better and safer driving experience. By partnering with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders, Waze aims to facilitate efficient and safe travel for as many individuals as possible.

In an initiative to reduce user churn on the Waze app, a project has been launched to address monthly user churn rates. This project forms a crucial part of Waze's broader strategy to drive growth. High retention rates are typically indicative of satisfied users who consistently engage with the app. By developing a churn prediction model, Waze seeks to mitigate churn, enhance user retention, and bolster its business expansion efforts.
